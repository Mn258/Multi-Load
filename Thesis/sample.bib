ABSTRACT = {A practical task assignment is one of the core issues of a multi-robot system. In this paper, a multi-robot task assignment strategy based on load balancing is proposed to effectively balance and plan out the execution cost of each robot when it has a large number of working task points. Considering the variability of the execution task cost in practical situations with different task point categories, the multi-robot task assignment (MRTA) problem is transformed into a multiple traveling salesman problem (MTSP) using a multi-angle K-means clustering algorithm. To solve the problem of unbalanced cost consumed by each robot after clustering assignment, which leads to low efficiency of system completion, a two-stage load-balancing strategy is presented. The first stage of this strategy makes a large adjustment to the unbalanced task set, and the second stage achieves a small fine-tuning to the unbalanced task set. The experimental results show that the standard deviation of the cost ratio of each set decreases when four robots perform the task between 100 and 550 work points using the load-balancing strategy. The reduction in standard deviation is between 3.53% and 83.44%. The maximum cost of individual robots decreases between 0.18% and 14.27%. The proposed method can effectively solve the uneven execution cost of each robot in the task assignment process and improve the efficiency of the system in completing tasks.},
